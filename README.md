## Features

- Added search (filtering) to all icon sets
- Powered by [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org) which is amazingly fast!
- Ability to copy either the icon's name, icon html, or icon HEX
- Future support for a PWA

## Crowdfunding
It's also possible to support the project on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/lexxyungcarter) or by buying products and merchandise at [Marketplace](https://marketplace.acelords.space).

This funding is used for maintaining the project and adding new features into Code Style plus other open-source repositories.


## So, Where's the Demo?

## Installation
- Clone the repo and simple, start using it offline, forever! (Which, from my studies, is a heck of a long time)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:lexxyungcarter/offline-icons-reference.git
``` 
### Tips
If using [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/valet), you can follow these steps:
- create an 'offline' folder in your development space
```bash
git clone git@github.com:lexxyungcarter/offline-icons-reference.git offline
```
- bookmark the folder and simply...get started!
